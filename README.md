## Prerequisites

- Linux operating system;

## Installing

- Download the project files;
- It is recommended to use [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html?highlight=venv#module-venv) for project isolation.

## Using

- Start a game:

```bash
python game.py
```

- Control the spaceship with the arrows. Avoid crash with garbage;
